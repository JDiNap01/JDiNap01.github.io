This page reviews a couple of projects I am working on in my Bioinformatics/Biostatistics Class. My current project analyses data on different dog breeds and the relationship between breed size and their affection towards children. 


## Work with Penguins Data

I started learning how to use R by working with a dataset involving Palmer Penguins. The analysis involved a small dataset involving 44 penguins. If you want to see my analysis, you can see it [here](https://JDiNap01.github.io/BioStatisticsAnalysis/PalmerPenguins_Initial.html) 


## Work with Breed data 

To learn about exploratory data and inference, I choose to analyze a dataset composed of 195 dog breeds and various traits associated with them. I created a hypothesis that the size of a dog breed correlated to the qualtiy of its relationship with young children. If you want to see my analysis, you can see it [here](https://JDiNap01.github.io/BioStatisticsAnalysis/BreedTraits.html) 

#Origin of Replication Project

To apply my knowledge of R Studio to Bioinformatics, I worked on challenges related to finding the Origin of Replication in the genome of E. Coli bacteria. I worked on the first five notebooks of the project.
